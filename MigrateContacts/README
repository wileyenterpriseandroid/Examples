This repository contains the code for the Example in chapter 10
of "Enterprise Android" from Wrox Press.

This project was tested on an ARM emulator for a Galaxy Nexus device,
running Android API Level 15, Ice Cream Sandwich, with a gig of memory.
It should run, as well, on most any device, API Level 14 or greater.

This MigrateContacts application depends on the Migrate project SDK
and will work only on a device that has an installed Migrate client
(migrate-client.apk). You must configure the Migrate client to
communicate with a valid Migrate backend service instance that
implements the WebData API.

This README describes the following tasks:

- Setting up a local Migrate service instance.
- Running the Migrate Proxy (migrate-client.apk).
- Configuring the MigrateContacts project.
- Creating and posting contact schema.
- Compiling and running the Migrate contacts APK.


Get started:

--------------------------------------------------
1. Download the Migrate SDK from the following location:

https://github.com/wileyenterpriseandroid/migrate/wiki

Instructions refer to the unpacked directory as $MIGRATE_SDK.

The SDK contains the following items:

- migrate-beta.war
- migrate-client-beta.apk
- SDK build files (contract generation and POST)


--------------------------------------------------
2. Run the migrate service using Tomcat:

Make sure that you have a mysql instance running with root
credentials as:

User: root
Pass: mysql

Copy the migrate.war binary to the Tomcat webapps directory:

cp $MIGRATE_SDK/migrate.war $CATALINA_HOME/webapps
$CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh
$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh

Note: Use .bat on windows.

Verify that the service is running by loading the following URL in a browser:
http://localhost:8080/migrate

The location display information about Migrate.

--------------------------------------------------
3. Configure MigrateContacts

Follow the instructions in migrate.xml.
There is a copy of a typical migrate.properties file in the tools
directory (./tools)

- Drag and drop or copy migrate.properties into place:

cd $CODE/MigrateContacts
cp tools/migrate.properties .

- Drag and drop or copy migrate.xml into place:

cd $CODE/MigrateContacts
cp $MIGRATE_SDK/migrate.xml .

- Drag and drop or copy migrate.properties into place and edit it for your project.

cp tools/migrate.properties .

Likely the defaults will work.

--------------------------------------------------
4. Compile your schema contract class:

cd $CODE/MigrateContacts
ant -f build-schema.xml

This ant task outputs the following class that directs the generation
of the Migrate contacts API:

build/classes-schema/com/enterpriseandroid/migratecontacts/Contact.class

--------------------------------------------------
5. Generate the schema contract:

- This command creates a data API for your Android application using
the class from the previous step:

ant -f migrate.xml

On success, the code will create the following source file:

$CODE/MigrateContacts/gen/com/enterpriseandroid/migratecontacts/ContactContract.java

--------------------------------------------------
6. Post the schema to the migrate service:

ant -f migrate.xml postSchema

This command makes the MigrateContacts schema available to the
migrate service where migrate clients can use it to sync. Schema
is generated form the class in step 4.

- Test your posted schema, by using curl to retrieve it:

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/migrate/schema/com.enterpriseandroid.migratecontacts.Contact

Should return:

{"wd_id":"com.enterpriseandroid.migratecontacts.Contact","wd_version":1,"wd_classname":"com.migrate.webdata.model.PersistentSchema","wd_updateTime":1375631349189,"wd_namespace":"__schema","wd_deleted":false,"jsonSchema":{"properties":{"wd_version":{"required":true,"type":"integer"},"wd_deleted":{"required":true,"type":"integer"},"phoneNumber":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"lastname":{"type":"string"},"wd_id":{"required":true,"type":"string"},"wd_namespace":{"type":"string"},"firstname":{"type":"string"},"wd_classname":{"type":"string"},"wd_updateTime":{"required":true,"type":"long"}},"type":"object"},"indexList":null,"status":0}

--------------------------------------------------
7. Install and run the migrate-client.apk from the SDK:

- Run the android emulator, as you've seen in earlier chapters,
you can run the emulator using the command line with the AVD manager,
or using Eclipse. Once its running, install the Migrate client APK:

adb install $MIGRATE_SDK/migrate-client.apk

The binary client in the SDK assumes that the service uses the
android Emulator host (10.0.2.2), or localhost. Currently, you must
build the client from source to configure a different backend
service.

On success, you will see a Toast that says, "Migrate is up!"

--------------------------------------------------
8. Activate Migrate sync using:

Settings -> Accounts (webdata SyncAdapter) -> Check the sync checkbox.

--------------------------------------------------
9. Configure MigrateContacts for use with Eclipse, there are a
few ways to do this:

- Import MigrateContacts into Eclipse
Import -> General...
== Building with Eclipse
In order to build this project, using eclipse, you will, first, have to
copy the necessary project files into the project root directory
The needed file are:
tools/ide/eclipse/project => .project
tools/ide/eclispe/classpath => .classpath
tools/project.properties => project.properties

=== From Windows Explorer:
Navigate to this directory (e.g., C:\Users\[user-name]\ea-examples\MigrateContacts\tools)
 and double click the file "setup.bat"

It seems that Explorer will not change the name of a file so that
it begins with a period (.), so dragging and renaming may not work.

=== From a Windows CMD prompt:
Navigate to the project tools directory and use the setup.bat file
The user "blake" might, for instance, do this:
C:\Users\blake\ea-examples\MigrateContacts>cd tools
C:\Users\blake\ea-examples\MigrateContacts\tools>setup.bat

=== From a *NIX shell prompt like Cygwin
$ cd tools
$ . setup.sh

=== Using ant
Move the file "build.xml" to the root directory and then:
# on Windows: copy tools\build.xml .
$ cp tools/build.xml .
$ ant eclipse

Once the project has been set up, from eclipse:

Import... >> General >> Existing Projects into Workspace

Note that "Import >> Android >> Existing Android Code into Workspace"
is something else entirely.  It may work, but if you use it you are
on your own.

Occasionally, eclipse gets confused about the version of the Java compiler
to use on a newly imported project.  If you see messages about the compiler
compliance level, try using Properties >> Java Compiler to change the
"Compiler compliance level" to anything other than its current value.
"Apply" the change, and then change it again, to 1.6

----------
10. Run the MigrateContacts client:

Select Run As Android application in Eclipse to start the Migrate Contacts project.

---

Congratulations, you have successfully installed a Migrate service
and the Migrate Contacts demonstration client. You can now sync like you
did in the other examples.



== Building Migrate Contacts with Ant

These instructions assume a *NIX shell prompt.  If you are using
 Windows CMD you will have to adapt them appropriately.

To build this project with ant, you need two files;

local.properties
build.xml

Both of these files can be generated using the "android" tool
(assuming you have put the directory $ANDROID_HOME/sdk/tools onto your $PATH)

$ android update project --path .

There is also a build.xml file in ./tools which should be identical
to the one produced by the command above, except that it contains
the "eclipse" target, which sets this project up for eclipse.
